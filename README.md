  To be filled
- Purpose of this project : 
  This is a personal project for two purposes. One is to experience typical tasks of website development such as handling various UI components(button, modal, layouts, tab, etc), data request/response with JSON/AJAX, login/out, DB modeling/handling and combining front&back-end. The other reason is to get used to Django(w/ Python) and HTML/JS/CSS by using jQuery/Bootstrap to enhance the productivity. I only knew pure HTML, JS, CSS before developing this project.
- Front : HTML, Javascript(jQuery), CSS with Bootstrap
  Back : Django, a Python based web framework
